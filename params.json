Once you've accomplished some work and you want to switch back, simply unfocus:\r\n\r\n    > unfocus\r\n    Unfocusing..were you productive?\r\n\r\nFocus is easy to get started with and is careful about clobbering your /etc/hosts file.\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n\r\n    Download the focus.sh script and source it in your .bashrc or .bash_profile\r\n\r\n        source ~/bin/focus.sh\r\n\r\n**Warning:** I recommend backing up your **/etc/hosts** file first. Focus is careful (and backs up to /tmp/hosts.bak automatically), but better safe than sorry.\r\n\r\nAdd some entries to **$HOME/.focus**\r\n\r\n    > cat $HOME/.focus\r\n    news.ycombinator.com\r\n    reddit.com\r\n    mail.google.com\r\n    digg.com\r\n    techmeme.com\r\n    techcrunch.com\r\n    mixpanel.com\r\n    twitter.com\r\n    api.twitter.com\r\n        \r\nJump in and out of focus mode:\r\n\r\n    > focus\r\n    > ping mail.google.com\r\n    PING mail.google.com (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes\r\n    ....\r\n\r\n    > unfocus\r\n    > ping mail.google.com\r\n    PING mail.google.com (209.85.225.19): 56 data bytes\r\n    ..\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n@bradjasper\r\n","google":"UA-11057852-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
